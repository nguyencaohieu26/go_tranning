- Struct:
  - No inheritance in golang
  - No super or parent
  - Methods:
    - A function that go into a classes -> It's call a method
    - Methods allow a logical grouping of behaviour related to type similar to classes.
    - Methods of anonymous struct
    - Important Points:
      - Whenever you pass Object to the struct -> pass into the copy -> where pointer comming in to solve this problem
      - The method contains a receiver argument in it.
      - With the help of the receiver argument, the method can access the properties of the receiver
      - The receiver can be of struct type or non-struct type
      - Methods of the same name but different types can be defined in the program
    - When a method has a value receiver, it will accept both pointer & value receiver
